# Application-of-Data-Analysis-Factor-Graphs-in-HPC-Security

The goal of this project is to understand the progression of a multi-stage attack that aims to leak secret keys from the target system. In this project, we will perform data analysis of a multi-stage attack recreated from publicly available information on the Equifax breach. We will explore the use of signature-based, anomaly-based, and factor graph-based analysis techniques.
